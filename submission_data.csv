This morning at wtc.,Walking to get my train around 8:00am.

Spotted at Kew Gardens yesterday,,xddxh4,None,https://i.redd.it/w3nimu9n0on91.jpg,1241,188,1663091967.0,"[{'body': 'Woowee.\n\nA highly trafficked, highly upvoted post regarding a hot topic. Well, will bring up a few things:\n\n* Per the MTA rules ([§1050.4(a) of the MTA Rules for the Ride (PDF)](https://new.mta.info/document/36821)), a fare payment ""or tender of other valid fare media"" is required to enter the Subway, without exception. Per this sub\'s rules, this post breaks Rule 3. However, given the popularity of this post, and that the idea of entering through an emergency exit isn\'t exactly rare, I feel it best to leave the post up.\n* I will ask that people do try and follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) as best they can. Despite this being a large, pseudonymous gathering, it is ever my hope that discussion can remain focused on concepts and ideas, rather than personal attacks.\n* On that note, I have removed a few comments here for Rule 1. We will be keeping an eye on this post, and will try to break up namecalling arguments should they arise.\n\nThank you.', 'author': 'Tervia'}, {'body': 'Ayyyeeee killa kg.. home of many subway graffiti artists and rebellious youth.. even tho they live in one of the best parts of queens.

These people also go to the exact same 2-3 places every week, which is usually work, home, and an occasional night out.\n\nSure the subway won’t exactly take you to your doorstep but it’s so much more affordable, and I assume it’s better for the environment as well.\n\nUnfortunately I think suburban American culture has made it a point to emphasize the idea of “individuality”, where everyone needs to own a cookie cutter house and 2 gas guzzling SUV’s.\n\nI know where I used to live they were trying to expand public transportation almost 30 miles from the city, but it was canceled because so many of the suburb towns thought that it would bring “lower class people” in. \n\nSo there’s multiple reasons why we see 10 lane highways in certain areas', 'author': 'None'}, {'body': 'How many lanes of pain and torture is that?
