basketball,Doctor says it‚Äôs over,"I‚Äôm 43 years old and have played the game for nearly my entire life.

I am old, I can no longer play without pain, and risk doing more damage every time I‚Äôm out there. I believe basketball to be the greatest game in the world.

basketball,I started cheating. And it can't be this easy.,"Been playing for past 15 years, the highest level I played was semi pro overseas at PG. I'm well passed my prime and just play as a weekend warrior for fun. I can drive and dribble with me left and right hand, and also can lay it up with left or right hand. I have your basic cross over between the legs that iv always used to get by. 

Playing with people 10 years younger than me, iv noticed that everyone basically cheats on offense, whether push offs, carrying, the ball, or this bs hand slapping the defenders hand away. 
Once I realized that I'll never play a competitive organized Game of basketball, I started to dribble like these young fools. 
I started to carry the ball putting my hand under and added a hesitation dribble. Once I started doing this, it was basically cheating. I blow by defenders like it was nothing because they think I'm going to shoot it everytime. I do a crossover, counter whatever the defense is doing, then hesitation. It works everytime. 
This move is basically broken. It creates an unlimited ammunition for the offense. And if I'm being honest, it's purely cheating.",169bdd2,vreddit123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/169bdd2/i_started_cheating_and_it_cant_be_this_easy/,685,243,1693782565.0,"[{'body': 'If it\'s blatant most guys I play with will say ""watch the carry"" or ""that was a travel but okay"" and usually people tone it down.

nba,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA‚Äôs 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search ‚Äú\[CITY\] Strip Clubs‚Äù (e.g., ‚ÄúDetroit Strip clubs‚Äù). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden‚Äôs game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden‚Äôs box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city‚Äôs strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden‚Äôs best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden‚Äôs worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

Paid trolls?\n\nIf there's anyone that is on Fertitta's side, please spend 5 minutes googling the long long list of inhuman Chinese government acts. As an example, there are presently a speculated million Uighur Muslims being kept in POW camps. There are drone videos showing them shackled and blindfolded for hours. There are reports of beatings, rape, and killings. Some have suggested they are killing them to harvest organs for transplants. You think that's silly? Well, they admitted to harvesting organs from deceased prisoners a few years ago. And the organ transplant wait time in China is the best in the world.\n\nFuck Chinese government and businesses."", 'author': 'DontCallMeTodd'}]",0.96,3
