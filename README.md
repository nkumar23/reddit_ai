# reddit_ai
reddit_data_extraction.py -- pulls in data from a defined set of fields from the Reddit API and exports the data as both .csv and .json files  

openAI_api -- sends the .json data file to GPT-4 and gives it a prompt to help summarize the data  

Just finished:
- adding more subreddits
- chunking data for submission as context to GPT-4 API

Coming next:
- adding more social media sources
- a light web app with a user interface (unstyled first)
