After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA\u2019s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search \u201c\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs\u201d (e.g., \u201cDetroit Strip clubs\u201d). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden\u2019s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden\u2019s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city\u2019s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden\u2019s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden\u2019s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won\u2019t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up.
