Well, will bring up a few things:\n\n* Per the MTA rules ([\u00a71050.4(a) of the MTA Rules for the Ride (PDF)](https://new.mta.info/document/36821)), a fare payment \"or tender of other valid fare media\" is required to enter the Subway, without exception. Per this sub's rules, this post breaks Rule 3. However, given the popularity of this post, and that the idea of entering through an emergency exit isn't exactly rare, I feel it best to leave the post up.\n* I will ask that people do try and follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) as best they can. Despite this being a large, pseudonymous gathering, it is ever my hope that discussion can remain focused on concepts and ideas, rather than personal attacks.\n* On that note, I have removed a few comments here for Rule 1. We will be keeping an eye on this post, and will try to break up namecalling arguments should they arise.\n\nThank you.", "author": "Tervia"}, {"body": "Ayyyeeee killa kg.. home of many subway graffiti artists and rebellious youth.. even tho they live in one of the best parts of queens.
